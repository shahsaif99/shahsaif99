## I'm Software Engineer.

I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. 

I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus., I realized software engineering was the right field for me.

Since then, I’ve worked on many freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. 

I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Vue, Nuxt and React JS, but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers, so feel free to connect!
